Hi. Iâ€™m AndrÃ©s Torres. I am a passionate engineering leader, developer, architect, and public speaker from Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, after living in Amsterdam ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± and London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ (#bollocksToBrexit), I'm back home working remotely.

I love sharing knowledge and explaining technology, both internally and externally. Some examples:

* [Kubernetes local development: Presentation of useful tools to develop with Kubernetes locally](https://www.youtube.com/live/jr289QSMmS4?feature=share&t=6401)
* [Shift Left your data access layer testing, a success story](https://web.archive.org/web/20220624220043/https://www.expoqa.com/en-sessions.html#day3)
* [Friends don't let friends test with In-Memory databases](https://youtu.be/AGDvuEkSM5E)
* [From on-prem to SaaS: our (bumpy) journey to the Cloud](https://youtu.be/fTeukkk3gIw)

I work at [Kalyp](http://www.kalyp.com) as CTO. I write articles for [**Medium**](https://medium.com/@towerspro)
